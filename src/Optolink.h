 * @brief Optolink API definitions
 *
 * This file contains all method definitions for the Optolink. 
 * The optolink object is the high level class and contains the interface 
 * and implements the queue system. Protocol details are implemented in the 
 * inherited classes.
 * 
 * The optolink hardware implementation could be as follows:
 * 
 *                          3.3V
